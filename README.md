# Assignment - Copy a webiste
--------------------------------------

This was an assignment I had where I got a website and my job was to try an recreate it styling on the website. I needed to make it look almost identical or completly identical to the original.

The result was very good. It became almost, if not identical to the original even doe the solution codewise might be different.

The site was going to have SASS ass the styling extention tool to CSS. In the scss-files I also use the concept of mixins and variables. 

A gulpfile is there as help to help complie the scss-files in case of any change aswell as to minify the css-file.

The site is responsive.

--------------------------------------
### Get started!
--------------------------------------

To see and test the features of the website, clone repo with command `git clone` and move in the project folder using the `cd` command in the terminal.

Then run the command: `npm install node-sass` s√• the node-modules folder is added to the project folder.

Then you're all set!

Have fun!
